A. Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do:

1.Image Input
-Users can upload a food image via a web interface (Streamlit / web app).
-Support for common image formats: JPG, PNG, BMP.

2. Food Recognition
-Automatically identify the food type in the image using a pre-trained or custom deep learning model.
-Support multiple categories (e.g., pizza, burger, salad, apple, etc.).

3. Calorie Estimation
-Estimate approximate calories based on food type and portion size.
-Display calories per serving and optionally macronutrient breakdown (carbs, protein, fat).

4. Results Display
-Show food label (name), predicted calories, and optionally nutritional info.
-Provide visual feedback (like confidence score or bounding box if multiple foods are detected).

5. History or Logging (Optional)
-Save user queries and results for tracking daily intake.

B. Non-Functional Requirements
These describe how the system performs:

Performance
-Food recognition should return results within a few seconds.
-Model accuracy ≥ 85% for main food categories.

2. Usability
-Simple and intuitive interface for users of all ages.
-Mobile-friendly web interface.

3. Scalability
-Able to handle multiple requests concurrently (if deployed online).

4. Reliability
-Handle incorrect or unclear images gracefully with an error or retry message.

5. Accessibility
-Include proper labels for images and inputs (for screen readers).
-Avoid empty labels (important for Streamlit warnings).

3. Technical Requirements
These describe the tools, libraries, and models you’ll need:

Programming Language
-Python 3.10 or higher

2. Libraries / Frameworks
-Deep Learning / Computer Vision: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, PIL
-Data Handling & Processing: NumPy, Pandas
-Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Web Interface: Streamlit
-Image Preprocessing: torchvision.transforms (if PyTorch) or tf.image (if TensorFlow)

3. Pre-trained Models (Optional)

-MobileNet, ResNet, EfficientNet for food classification
-Transfer learning on a food dataset (e.g., Food-101)

4. Dataset
-Food images dataset: Food-101, custom images, or other open datasets
-Calorie/nutritional data: USDA Food Database or other nutrition datasets

5. Hardware
-GPU recommended for faster model training
-CPU sufficient for inference on small models

6. Optional Features
-Portion size estimation using image segmentation
-Integration with calorie tracking apps
